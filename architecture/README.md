# Overview

This document describes the high-level architecture of framework. The focus here
is on the protocol itself.


## Bird's Eye View

If we put the entirety of framework onto one picture, we get something like this:

Don't worry if this doesn't yet make a lot of sense: hopefully, by the end of
this document the above picture would become much clearer!

* [**Node**](./node/) talks about how the code works.
  So, for example, if you are interested in how a transaction flows through the
  system, look there!
* [**Miner**](./miner/) describe, broadly, how we write code.
  For example, if you want to learn about code style, issue tracking, or
  debugging performance problems, this is the chapter for you.
* [**Container Cloud**](./container_cloud/) describe, broadly, how we write code.
  For example, if you want to learn about code style, issue tracking, or
  debugging performance problems, this is the chapter for you.
