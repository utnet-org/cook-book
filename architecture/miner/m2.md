# 一. 芯片相关rpc接口
调用均在worker机上完成，先启动worker机，访问rpc url为：workerIP:6001
```sh
### startchips is the activation of chips before any operation of it (for 1684x chip, the driver will automatically activate, and user can skip manually "startchips")
## "url" is url address, can be left unfilled here.  "serial" is the serial number of the tpu card, "bus_id" is the sequence number of chip in the card, can be left unfilled, "dev_id" is the sequence number of the chip, it can be 0,1,..., up to 17.
## return results："status"，"msg"(if it starts chip successfully or not)
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "startchips",
  "params": {
    "url": "",
    "serial": "",

```

# 二. 调用链上节点相关rpc接口
调用均在miner机上完成，先按照run_a_node.md的指示先安装utility node，unc-validator和utility-cli-rust，然后启动miner服务（启动办法请看m1.md）。通过cli直接获取新账户或者启动miner的getmineraccountkeys服务或者新账户，配置到节点里的validator_key.json，则可以启动节点，并访问以下一系列rpc服务。\
注意访问 rpc url为：minerIP:8001
```sh
### getmineraccountkeys is generate new public keys and address for a miner as account.
## "node_path" is your command path of unc cli after installing utility-cli-rs, forms is like "path/to/unc". "mnemonic" is mnemonic to generate new public key and address, it can be empty if you haven't an account yet and it will randomly generate a new address, or you want to export an address using a known mnemonic, then just type the mnemonic.
## return results："pubKey"，"address"
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "getmineraccountkeys",
  "params": {
    "node_path": "unc",
    "mnemonic": "one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve"
  } 
}

### claimpledge is to pledge/deposit certain UNC to be qualified to report blocks, "account_id".
## "account_id" is the miner address. "amount" is how much you want to pledge, unit is UNC. Please attention about the threshold, if the pledge is lower than the threshold, it will not be included as validator. "node_path" is your command path of unc-validator after cargo installing unc-validator, forms is like "path/to/unc-validator". "key_path" is defaulted as empty. "net" is either "testnet" or "mainnet"
## return results："txid" the transaction id on chain
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "claimpledge",
  "params": {
    "account_id": "",
    "amount": "",
    "node_path": "unc",
    "key_path": "",
    "net": "testnet",
  }
}

### addchipkeys is to add the key of the chip to a miner, pre-step of claiming the computation.
## "account_id" is the miner address. "chip_pubkey" public key of the chip which miner is claiming, unit is UNC. "node_path" is your command path of unc cli after installing utility-cli-rs, forms is like "path/to/unc". "net" is either "testnet" or "mainnet"
## return results："txid" the transaction id on chain
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "addchipkeys",
  "params": {
    "account_id": "",
    "chip_pubkey": "",
    "node_path": "unc",
    "net": "testnet",
  }
}

### claimcomputation is to authorize the claim of computation of chip by challenge the public key of chip with your account keys, ex, if the chip you claim possesses 10T, then you claim 10T computation.
## "account_id" is the miner address. "chip_pubkey" public key of the chip which miner is claiming, unit is UNC. "node_path" is your command path of unc cli after installing utility-cli-rs, forms is like "path/to/unc". "key_path" is defaulted as empty. "net" is either "testnet" or "mainnet"
## return results："txid" the transaction id on chain
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "claimcomputation",
  "params": {
    "account_id": "",
    "challenge_key_path": "",
    "signer_key_path": "",
    "node_path": "unc",
    "net": "testnet",
  }
}

### minerchipsList is to list all chips claimed by the miner.
## "account_id" is the miner address.
## return results：return a list of struct containing : {"serialNumber", "BusId", "power", "p2", "publicKey", "p2Size", "publicKeySize"}
{
  "jsonrpc": "1.0",
  "id": "dontcare",
  "method": "minerchipsList",
  "params": {
    "account_id": ""
  }
}

```

# 三. miner的http接口
访问miner的http url为：minerIP:8001
```sh
### ListAllChipsHandler: is to obtain all details of all chips at all your available chips workers
### 此调用必须也要开启worker rpc服务，调度worker机获得所有芯片信息
### router：http://minerIP:8001/chipService/ListAllChips?url=ip1,ip2&serialNum=&busId=
## "url" is the list of worker server ip address, input the ones that you have, like ip1 ip2. "serialNumber" is the serial number of the tpu card, "bus_id" is the sequence number of chip in the card, the number can be 0 1 2, "serialNumber"and"bus_id" is set to empty for all search, if it is set to specific value, it will search a certain chip, and the "url" must be the right worker server which possess the chip.
## return results："signature"，"status"
{
    "url": ["","",""],
    "serialNum": "",
    "busId": ""
}

### ViewAccountHandler: is to obtain all details of all chips at all your available chips workers
### router：http://minerIP:8001/chainService/ViewAccount?accountId=account id
## "accountId" is the account id (miner address).
## return results："total"(amount on balance)，"pledge"(amount to be pledged),"rewards","slashed","power"(unit in TeraBytes)
{
    "accountId": ""
}

```
